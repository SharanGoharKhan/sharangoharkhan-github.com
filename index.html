                In my MS program my main focus is to prepare myself for a data-scientist role. So I have decided my electives as Machine Learning, Distritubed Data Engineering, Data Mining and Deep Learning.
                In Machine Learning course I have gotten an understanding of common algorithms used in Machine Learning: Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, KNN, Neural Network etc.
                In course Data Distributed Engineering I have gotten understanding of Hadoop Framework:
                Setting up configuring Hadoop, YARN, HDFS and running Map Reduce operation. Higher level languages such as Pig Latin.
                In course Data mining I have gotten deeper understanding of using python for implementation of algorithms:
                Using python libraries pandas, scikit-learn and numpy. Implementation side of python.
                In course Deep Learning I have got deeper understanding of implementation of neural network:
                Using Tensor Flow with python and implementing neural networks from scratch.
